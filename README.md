# JavaScript Practice Repository

This repository contains my JavaScript practice code from **BASIC to ADVANCED** using **Visual Studio Code**.
All topics are organized step by step, without mixing concepts, for clear learning and reference.

## CONTENTS:

**1. IMPLEMENTATION WITH HTML:**
- Linking JavaScript with HTML (`<script>` tag).
- Internal, External, and Inline JS.
- Writing output: `console.log()`, `document.write()`, `innerHTML`.
